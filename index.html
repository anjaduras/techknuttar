        <h1>Hello everyone!</h1>
        <p>lorem ipsum lorem ipsum</p>

            <h2>HTML & CSS</h2>
            <p>lorem ipsum</p>
            <p>
              Your classic college sweethearts. With HTML (his name would
              probably be Henry or something) being basic classy man who spends
              his time reading and occasionally engaging in philosophical
              conversations and CSS (probably named Casey) being the golden
              retriever of the couple and spending time taking up a new creative
              hobby everyday they balance each other out like no other couple
              can.
            </p>
            <p>Also typical for this couple:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Not an extraverted pair: Friday Nights are Netflix-and-Chill
                Nights.
              </li>
              <li>HTML only dresses in H&M (ironic) or Zara</li>
              <li>
                CSS loves to cook and often burns the whole kitchen which HTML
                then has to clean up
              </li>
              <li>
                They plan on getting a pet but CSS is more of a cat person
                whereas HTML wants a Labrador.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>JAVA SCRIPT</h2>
            <p>
              The one person whose music is so loud you hear it from their
              headphones. Popular on social media, a trendsetter and also hard
              to talk to because even though they are super funny and
              interesting they get bored easily and are also absolutely
              unstable.
            </p>
            <p>Also typical for JS:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Dye their hair every three weeks (Ramona Flowers reference)
              </li>
              <li>Love thrift stores and window-shopping</li>
              <li>Will correct you on peoples pronouns (aggressively)</li>
              <li>
                Friends with CSS and also in competitive relationship with
                Python

            <h2>PYTHON</h2>
            <p>
              The guy you imidiately want to befriend. Super easy to talk to, a
              hero of problem solving and also just fun to be around. In my
              world Python in probably named James or Brian and hes always
              carryng all his hardware around bus somehow still manages to look
              cool.

              <li>
                Minimalistic and quality oriented: when he finds one good
                sweater, he would probably buy 6 more of them to wear everyday
              </li>
              <li>Perfect handwriting</li>

            <h2>SQL</h2>
            <p>
              The ultimate girl boss. So detail oriented it may be overwhelming
              at first, but also very professional and reliable. SQL is always
              working and taking new tasks, to have a date with her you would
              probably need to fight for a spot in 5 weeks from now. Although it
              would be complicated to get with her as she's exclusively dating
              Excel.

                Not really strong creative side is compensated by examplatory

              <li>
                A fast responder - she would probably answer right away even

            <h2>C++</h2>

              The mystical, quiet one of the group. The closest figure that
              comes to mind in terms of personality is L from Death Note -
              except C++ is a girl and diabetic. Lots of people are scared of
              her or talking behind her back (the same goes to all of the
              members of C family). But maybe if you actually got to know her
              you'll find out shes a really helpful sweet girl with a good taste
              in computer games? *I don't know, I've never got this far.

                At her home she'll serve you frozen food you'll need to heat up
                yourself.
              </li>
              <li>
                At the group work she'll make the whole presentation herself
                because she's sure noone can make it as good as her
